helloha world, I have no idea what I am doing at the moment, in my short life I feel as though I have yet to find something I am truly proficient at, I am trying to change that. 


I have a persian rug on the floor of my room, my dad tells me that my grandmother bought it in Iran, long before I was born. My grandmother has been gone for a long time, but the rug is still here.
