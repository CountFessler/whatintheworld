helloha world, I have no idea what I am doing at the moment, in my short life I feel as though I have yet to find something I am truly proficient at, I am trying to change that. 


You see, the question of "is a hot dog a sandwich?" has tormented me for as long as I can remember. It is beyond me. On the sufrace it seems like a harmless question.

But the deeper you look, you find no answers.
